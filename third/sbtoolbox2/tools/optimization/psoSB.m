% NOTE: DO NOT BREAK THE OPTIMIZATION USING CTRL-C! If you do that the Java
% optimization thread will keep running and taking a lot of CPU performance
% away. Ultimately you will have to restart MATLAB. INSTEAD, use the
% button, which is provided by this function, to stop the optimization.
% In the case this function is used together with the parameter esimation
% functionality from the SBPD package the default button will be replaced
% by the SBPD parameter estimations own button.
%
% USAGE:
% ======
% [info] = psoSB()
% [X,FVAL] = psoSB(FUN,X)
% [X,FVAL] = psoSB(FUN,X,OPTIONS)
%
% FUN:      Function to optimize 
% X:        Starting Guess
% OPTIONS:  Structure containing options for the algorithm. 
%        OPTIONS.maxfunevals: Maximum number of function evaluations
%        OPTIONS.tolfun: Termination tolerance on the function value
%        OPTIONS.tolx: Termination tolerance on X
%        OPTIONS.highbounds: vector containing upper bounds for parameters
%           Instead of a vector highbounds can also be a scalar > 1. In the
%           latter case the highbounds are determined by multiplying this
%           scalar to the initial parameter guess X. This latter case works
%           only for positive X(i) ... if negative present then the user
%           needs to specify a whole highbounds vector. 
%        OPTIONS.lowbounds: vector containing lower bounds for parameters.
%           Instead of a vector lowbounds can also be a scalar < 1. In the
%           latter case the lowbounds are determined by multiplying this
%           scalar to the initial parameter guess X. This latter case works
%           only for positive X(i) ... if negative present then the user
%           needs to specify a whole lowbounds vector. 
%        OPTIONS.silent: =0: output of info, =1: no output
%
% DEFAULT VALUES:
% ===============
% OPTIONS.maxfunevals:    2000*numberVariables
% OPTIONS.tolx:           0 (best to keep on 0!)
% OPTIONS.tolfun:         0 (best to keep on 0!)
% OPTIONS.lowbounds:      0.1  => lowbounds = 0.1*X 
% OPTIONS.highbounds:     10  => highbounds = 10*X 
% OPTIONS.silent:         0 (no output of info)
%
% Output Arguments:
% =================
% info: calling the function w/o input argument returns information about
%       the options and a flag indicating if the algorithm can handle
%       constraints or not
% X:        Found solution (The best particle obtained for the population (Leader))
% FVAL:     Value of the function FUN at X
